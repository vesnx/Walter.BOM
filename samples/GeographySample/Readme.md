## Use Case: Applying Geographic-Specific Promotions Without Duplication

**Background:** An e-commerce platform offers special promotions for customers in Latin America and South America. Some promotions are specific to countries, while others apply to entire regions. Given the overlap between these regions (e.g., countries like Brazil are part of both Latin America and South America), there's a risk of applying the same promotion multiple times to customers from overlapping countries.

**Challenge:** Ensure that each eligible country within overlapping regions is identified uniquely to apply promotions accurately without duplication, even when regions overlap.

**Solution:** Use the Expand method to convert regional representations into unique, constituent country-level GeoLocations. This approach guarantees that each country is considered only once when determining eligibility for promotions, regardless of regional overlaps.

### Implementation Example

```c#

// Sample regions with potential overlap
var promotionalRegions = new[] { GeoLocation.LATIN_AMERICA, GeoLocation.SOUTH_AMERICA };

// Expand regions into a unique list of constituent countries
var eligibleCountries = promotionalRegions.Expand().Distinct();

// Example function to apply promotions based on country
void ApplyPromotions(IEnumerable<GeoLocation> countries)
{
    foreach (var country in countries)
    {
        // Logic to apply country-specific promotions
        Console.WriteLine($"Applying promotions for {country}.");
    }
}

// Apply promotions without duplication
ApplyPromotions(eligibleCountries);

```

For the GetTwoLetterIsoCountryCode extension method, let's explore how developers can utilize this functionality to dynamically display country flags in both a Blazor application and a WPF application. The key to these examples is the method's ability to return a two-letter ISO country code, which is then used to construct a path to a flag image stored in the application's resources.

### Use Case: Displaying Country Flags Based on GeoLocation
**Scenario:** An application needs to show a visual representation of a country (its flag) next to user profiles, content, or within UI components that involve geographic information.

### Blazor Application Example
In a Blazor app, you might store flag images in the wwwroot/images/flags directory, naming each file with the country's two-letter ISO code followed by .png. You can then bind the GeoLocation of an entity to an <img> element's src attribute to display the corresponding flag.

### Sample Code:
```c#
@code {
    public GeoLocation UserLocation { get; set; } = GeoLocation.UnitedStates;

    public string GetFlagImagePath(GeoLocation location)
    {
        var countryCode = location.GetTwoLetterIsoCountryCode();
        return $"/images/flags/{countryCode}.png";
    }
}

<img alt="Country Flag" src="@GetFlagImagePath(UserLocation)" />


```
Description: This Blazor snippet demonstrates how to use the GetTwoLetterIsoCountryCode method within a component to dynamically generate the path to a country flag image based on the user's location.

### WPF Application Example with Converter

For a WPF application, you can create a value converter that takes a GeoLocation and returns the path to the corresponding flag image. This converter can then be used in XAML to bind a GeoLocation property directly to an image source.

### GeoLocationToFlagConverter.cs:
```c#
using System;
using System.Globalization;
using System.Windows.Data;
using System.Windows.Media.Imaging;

[ValueConversion(typeof(GeoLocation), typeof(BitmapImage))]
public class GeoLocationToFlagConverter : IValueConverter
{
    public object Convert(object value, Type targetType, object parameter, CultureInfo culture)
    {
        if (value is GeoLocation location)
        {
            var countryCode = location.GetTwoLetterIsoCountryCode();
            var imagePath = $"/images/flags/{countryCode}.png";
            return new BitmapImage(new Uri(imagePath, UriKind.Relative));
        }
        return null;
    }

    public object ConvertBack(object value, Type targetType, object parameter, CultureInfo culture)
    {
        throw new NotImplementedException();
    }
}


```

### Usage in XAML:

First, ensure the converter is accessible in your XAML, typically by declaring it in the resource dictionary:
```xaml
<Window.Resources>
    <local:GeoLocationToFlagConverter x:Key="FlagConverter" />
</Window.Resources>

```
Then, use the converter to bind a GeoLocation property to an Image element's Source:
```xaml
<Image Source="{Binding UserLocation, Converter={StaticResource FlagConverter}}" />


```
**Description:** This WPF example creates a GeoLocationToFlagConverter that converts a GeoLocation to a BitmapImage by using the GetTwoLetterIsoCountryCode method to find the corresponding flag image. This converter is then used in XAML to bind the GeoLocation directly to an image's source, displaying the country's flag in the UI.

Both examples demonstrate practical applications of the GetTwoLetterIsoCountryCode extension method, leveraging it to enhance the UI with relevant geographic visual cues.
